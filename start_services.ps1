# ==============================================================================
# Desktop Services Launcher for Vesper AI Pod (PowerShell Edition)
#
# Description:
# This script provides a single "launch button" to initialize all services
# on a remote RunPod instance from your local Windows terminal. It will prompt
# for the Pod IP and Port, then connect and execute the remote startup script.
#
# The remote script will launch the LLM server in the foreground, streaming
# its logs to this terminal.
#
# Usage:
# .\start_services.ps1
# ==============================================================================

# --- Configuration ---
# Prompt the user for the Pod IP and Port
$PodIp = Read-Host "Enter the Pod IP Address"
$PodPort = Read-Host "Enter the Pod SSH Port"

# --- Remote Path Configuration ---
$RemoteScriptPath = "/workspace/runpod-babylegs/start_remote_services.sh"
$LlamaPort = "8080" # Used for the final instructions

# --- Main Execution Block ---
Write-Host "üöÄ Connecting to pod to launch services..." -ForegroundColor Green

# The -t flag allocates a pseudo-terminal, which is required for the
# remote script to run interactively and stream logs back to us.
