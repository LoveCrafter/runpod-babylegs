# Description:
# This script provides a single, reliable "launch button" to initialize all
# services on a remote RunPod instance from your local Windows terminal.
#
# It accepts the Pod IP and Port as command-line arguments.

# Usage:
# .\start_services.ps1 -PodIp <YOUR_IP_ADDRESS> -PodPort <YOUR_PORT>
